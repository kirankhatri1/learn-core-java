// The exceptions which are checked by the compiler for smooth execution of the
//program at runtime are called checked exceptions.
// The exceptions which are not checked by the compiler are called un-checked
//exceptions.
// RuntimeException and its child classes, Error and its child classes are unchecked
//except these the remaining are checked exceptions.

//Rule: While overriding if the child class method throws any checked exception
//compulsory the parent class method should throw the same checked exception or its
//parent otherwise we will get compile time error.

// But there are no restrictions for un-checked exceptions.
