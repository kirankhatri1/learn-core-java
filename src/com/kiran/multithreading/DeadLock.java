// There are no resolution techniques for dead lock but several
//prevention(avoidance) techniques are possible.
// Synchronized keyword is the cause for deadlock hence whenever we are using
//synchronized keyword we have to take special care.

// Note : If we remove atleast one syncronized keywoed then we won't get
//DeadLOck.Hence syncronized keyword in the only reason for DeadLock due to this
//while using syncronized keyword we have to handling carefully.
