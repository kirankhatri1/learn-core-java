//If an interface doesn't contain any methods and by implementing that interface if our
//objects will get some ability such type of interfaces are called Marker interface (or) Tag
//interface (or) Ability interface.

//Without having any methods in marker interface how objects will get ability ?
//Internally JVM is responsible to provide required ability.

//Why JVM is providing the required ability in marker interfaces ?
//To reduce complexity of the programming.
